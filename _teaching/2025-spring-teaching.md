I taught 3, 3-hour sections of 10-15 students as lead teaching assistant for the course. In addition to preparing recitation slides, I designed and implemented worksheets to take the place of pre-quizzes over the material, designed a new lab report assignment for a previously-planned module, and oversaw an undergraduate TA.
