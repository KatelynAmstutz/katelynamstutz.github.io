Taught two, 3-hour lab sections of 12-20 students. I worked to engage the students in understanding plant science through hands-on examinatinos of plants from microscopy to longer-term experiments on genetics, tissue culture, and hormones. Preparation for each lab involved writing pre-quizzes over the material, and preparing a recitation about the topics to be covered in the lab. I additionally helped design and implement a new module covering Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional mutants and heavy metal stress. The students tested several mutants for heavy-metal tolerance, prepared genomic DNA, and carried out PCRs on the mutants to determine the presence or absence of the T-DNA mutation.
