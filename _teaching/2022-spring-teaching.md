Taught two, 3-hour lab sections of 12-20 students. I worked to engage the students in understanding plant science through hands-on examinatinos of plants from microscopy to longer-term experiments on genetics, tissue culture, and hormones. Preparation for each lab involved writing pre-quizzes over the material, and preparing a recitation about the topics to be covered in the lab.
