Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the lab of Dr. Iris Meier studying LINC complexes and the role of the nuclear envelope during drought-induced stomatal closure. My interests are in understanding the unique cell biology of plants, and how plant biology can give us a broader understanding of the breadth of biological possibility. 

Outside of research, I spend my time knitting and spinning, doing music, and reading.
